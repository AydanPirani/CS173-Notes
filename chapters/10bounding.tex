Use two subproofs, one for lower bound and one for upper.

\subsection{Marker Making}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Being able to cut out as many shapes as you can from fabric.
    \item If lower and upper bounds meet, then that's the answer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pigeonhole Point Placement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Break up a problem into smaller ones, then use one of those as a case.
    \item Identify why it wouldn't work in this case.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graph Coloring}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chromatic Color: Minimum colors needed to color a graph without neigbors being the same color.
    \item Need to show an upper bound (can be colored with n colors) and a lower bound (cannot be colored with less than n colors).
\end{itemize}
