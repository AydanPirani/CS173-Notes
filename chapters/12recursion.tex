\subsection{Recursive Definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two parts: \begin{itemize}
        \item Base case(s)
        \item Recursive formula
    \end{itemize}
    \item Need to have both, but can't label them differently.
    \item Inputs are assumed to be integers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Finding Closed Forms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can sometimes guess, but often need to use unrolling.
    \item Keep substituting a definition into itself until a pattern's clear.
    \item Can also apply summation formulas to make it cleaner.
    \item Find value of k at base case, then plug and chug.
\end{itemize}
