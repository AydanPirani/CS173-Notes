\subsection{Running Times of Programs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Need a way to see how well a program runs.
    \item Can't use time, because machines are always getting better and not uniform.
    \item Instead, we abstract away constants and stick to input-growth time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asymptotic Relationships}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We only look at the leading term of the polynomial.
    \item f and g are asympotically similar iff $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}} = c$, else f is smaller.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ordering Primitive Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SMALLEST
    \item Constant Functions
    \item Logarithms
    \item Polynomials (from smaller degree to higher)
    \item Exponents (from smaller degree to higher)
    \item Factorials
    \item LARGEST
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Dominant Term Method}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can simply neglect the non-dominant terms and constants: compare only dominant terms.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Big-O}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Places an upper bound on a function f(x), for all $x\geq k$.
\end{itemize}
